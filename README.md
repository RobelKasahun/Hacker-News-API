# Hacker-News-API

Hacker News API scrapes posts from Hacker News (hackernews.com) and stores them in a MongoDB NoSQL database for easy access. The data is then made available via a RESTful API, allowing users to retrieve the scraped posts using a simple GET request. This ensures that the posts are organized and can be efficiently queried for future use.
